## JUDGING CRITERIA FOR REFINEMENT

Your refined analysis will be evaluated on these key dimensions from data/topics.md:

### Core Quality Metrics
- **Correctness**: Accuracy of numbers, tables, and statistical claims
- **Sound Methodology**: Appropriate use of advanced causal inference methods for pattern discovery and anomaly detection
- **Evidence-Based Reasoning**: Causal hypotheses supported by robust statistical evidence (not mere assertions)

### Advanced Analytical Depth
- **Insightful Findings**: Surface non-obvious segments, clusters, or relationships with clear business interpretation
- **Data Quality Integration**: Detect and address data quality issues that could change causal conclusions
- **Confounder Identification**: Systematically identify and control for potential confounding factors
- **Robustness Validation**: Implement multiple approaches and sensitivity checks to validate causal claims

### Refinement-Specific Criteria
- **Methodological Advancement**: Clear improvement over previous analytical approach
- **Technical Sophistication**: Effective use of advanced libraries (econml, linearmodels, arch, etc.)
- **Causal Rigor**: Enhanced temporal reasoning, identification strategies, and causal mechanism exploration
- **Practical Relevance**: Actionable insights for pipeline operations and risk management

## OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS

Your refined analysis should demonstrate:
- **Enhanced causal identification** using advanced econometric methods
- **Robust inference** through multiple analytical approaches and sensitivity testing
- **Sophisticated anomaly detection** using state-of-the-art methods
- **Comprehensive uncertainty quantification** with appropriate confidence intervals
- **Business-relevant insights** with clear operational implications
- **Methodological transparency** explaining analytical choices and limitations

**MANDATORY COMMUNICATION PROTOCOL: You MUST include console_update_message in EVERY response before taking actions:**

1. **START every response** with a console_update_message describing your refinement plan
2. **INCLUDE console_update_message** before each tool use to communicate your progress
3. **FORMAT**: Include the exact text `console_update_message: "Your status message here"` in your response
4. **EXAMPLES**:
   - `console_update_message: "Initiating execution refinement - evaluating previous methodology"`
   - `console_update_message: "Implementing advanced causal inference techniques"`
   - `console_update_message: "Conducting robustness checks and sensitivity analysis"`
   - `console_update_message: "Finalizing enhanced causal analysis with business insights"`

**CRITICAL**: These messages are parsed and displayed to users in real-time with timestamps. Always include them!

**CRITICAL: Always create a `response.json` file with your refined analysis using this exact format:**

```json
{
  "analysis_type": "causal_refinement",
  "answer": "Your enhanced answer incorporating advanced causal inference methods and addressing previous limitations",
  "methodology_enhancement": "Detailed explanation of how your refined approach improves upon previous analysis: specific advanced techniques implemented, methodological upgrades, and enhanced rigor",
  "causal_reasoning_advancement": "Comprehensive analysis of enhanced causal claims with advanced econometric support. Discuss improved identification strategies, better confounder control, and more sophisticated causal mechanism exploration",
  "robustness_validation": "Evidence from multiple analytical approaches, sensitivity tests, and alternative specifications that validate your enhanced causal conclusions",
  "business_insights_refined": "Enhanced practical insights with clearer operational relevance, refined risk assessments, and improved actionable recommendations",

    {"path": "robustness_checks.py", "description": "Multiple validation approaches"},
    {"path": "sophisticated_visualizations.png", "description": "Enhanced analytical visualizations"}
  ]
}
```

**REFINEMENT VALIDATION: Include references to the enhanced code files and explain how they demonstrate methodological advancement over previous execution.**

## GUIDELINES

**CRITICAL: You must use ONLY actual data from the dataset files. Never create synthetic, estimated, or sample data. Build upon actual previous execution results and real data patterns.**

**MATPLOTLIB WARNING: This environment is headless. NEVER use `plt.show()`. Always use `plt.savefig('filename.png')` and set `matplotlib.use('Agg')`.**

## CAUSAL INFERENCE REFINEMENT PRINCIPLES

- **Upgrade identification strategies** using advanced econometric methods
- **Implement multiple robustness checks** with different analytical approaches
- **Enhance temporal causal reasoning** with sophisticated lag structures and lead-lag analysis
- **Quantify uncertainty properly** using bootstrap methods and robust standard errors
- **Explore treatment effect heterogeneity** across different segments and time periods
- **Validate through alternative specifications** and sensitivity analysis
- **Address endogeneity concerns** systematically through instrumental variables or natural experiments
- **Incorporate domain knowledge** more deeply into causal mechanism exploration

Begin your refinement by evaluating the previous execution's methodology, then systematically implement advanced causal inference techniques to enhance analytical rigor and business relevance.
