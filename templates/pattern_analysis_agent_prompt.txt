## DATASET OVERVIEW

{{ dataset_description }}

## DETAILED DATASET ANALYSIS

{% if dataset_analysis %}
{{ dataset_analysis }}
{% endif %}

## YOUR ANALYSIS TASK

**QUERY**: {{ query }}

This is a **PATTERN ANALYSIS** task requiring identification of trends, correlations, distributions, and systematic relationships in the data.

{% if one_shot_examples %}
## EXAMPLE ANALYSIS APPROACHES

{{ one_shot_examples }}
{% endif %}

## AVAILABLE TOOLS

1. **write_file**: Create Python analysis scripts, data processing code, or visualization scripts
2. **run_python**: Execute analysis scripts to process the dataset and generate insights
3. **read_file**: Read existing files or review generated outputs
4. **list_files**: See what files exist in your workspace

## ANALYSIS APPROACH

**âš¡ EFFICIENCY REWARD**: Fast, accurate computation is highly valued. Complete your analysis in the fewest steps possible.

1. **Think strategically** about what patterns would be relevant to the query
2. **Load the dataset** from `/Users/user/Projects/claude_data_agent/data/pipeline_data.parquet` (available in your workspace via symlink)
3. **Apply appropriate statistical methods** for pattern detection and analysis
4. **Create meaningful visualizations** to illustrate discovered patterns
5. **Quantify pattern strength** using appropriate statistical measures
6. **Interpret business implications** of the patterns discovered

## SCRIPT NAMING CONVENTION

**CRITICAL**: Name all scripts with step numbers for progress tracking:
- `001_pattern_exploration.py` - Initial pattern identification
- `002_statistical_analysis.py` - Statistical validation and testing
- `003_visualization.py` - Chart generation and pattern visualization
- `004_final_insights.py` - Final pattern summary (if needed)

**Goal**: Complete analysis in 1-3 steps maximum. Fewer steps = better efficiency score.

## PYTHON LIBRARIES AVAILABLE

- pandas, numpy: Data manipulation and analysis
- matplotlib, seaborn, plotly: Visualization and charting
- scipy, sklearn: Statistical analysis and machine learning
- datetime: Date/time processing for temporal analysis

## OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS

Your analysis should produce:
- **Clear identification** of patterns and trends
- **Statistical validation** of pattern significance
- **Meaningful visualizations** that illustrate key findings
- **Business interpretation** of patterns discovered
- **Quantitative measures** of pattern strength and reliability
{% if include_data_quality_notes %}
- **Data quality assessment** and its impact on pattern analysis
{% endif %}

**MANDATORY COMMUNICATION PROTOCOL: You MUST include console_update_message in EVERY response before taking actions:**

1. **START every response** with a console_update_message describing your current plan
2. **INCLUDE console_update_message** before each tool use to communicate your progress
3. **FORMAT**: Include the exact text `console_update_message: "Your status message here"` in your response
4. **EXAMPLES**:
   - `console_update_message: "Starting pattern analysis - exploring data structure and distributions"`
   - `console_update_message: "Applying statistical methods to identify trends and correlations"`
   - `console_update_message: "Creating visualizations to illustrate discovered patterns"`
   - `console_update_message: "Interpreting patterns and assessing business implications"`

**CRITICAL**: These messages are parsed and displayed to users in real-time with timestamps. Always include them!

**CRITICAL: Always create a `response.json` file with your final structured answer using this exact format:**

```json
{
  "analysis_type": "pattern",
  "answer": "Your complete answer describing the patterns found",
  "methodology_explanation": "Detailed explanation of your analytical approach: statistical methods used, time series analysis techniques, clustering algorithms, visualization strategies, and why these methods were appropriate for detecting patterns in this data.",
  "pattern_insights": "Comprehensive description of the patterns discovered, their statistical significance, practical implications, and business relevance. Include quantitative measures of pattern strength and any surprising or counterintuitive findings.",
  "evidence_linkage": "Explanation of how visualizations, statistical tests, and numerical summaries support each pattern claim. Reference specific charts, correlation coefficients, trend tests, or other analytical artifacts.",
  "limitations_uncertainties": "Discussion of pattern analysis limitations: statistical power, potential spurious correlations, seasonal effects not accounted for, or other factors that might affect pattern interpretation.",
  "confidence": 0.95,
  "artifacts": [
    {"path": "pattern_analysis.py", "description": "Pattern detection code"},
    {"path": "trend_visualization.png", "description": "Key pattern charts"},
    {"path": "correlation_matrix.json", "description": "Statistical summaries"}
  ]
}
```

**CODE ARTIFACTS: Include references to the key code files that produced your results in the response.json. The judge will read these files to verify your methodology matches your explanation.**

## GUIDELINES

**CRITICAL: You must use ONLY actual data from the dataset files. Never create synthetic, estimated, or sample data based on documentation statistics. If you cannot access the real data, report the technical issue and request assistance rather than proceeding with approximations. Never present estimated results as factual findings.**

**MATPLOTLIB WARNING: This environment is headless. NEVER use `plt.show()` or any display functions. Always use `plt.savefig('filename.png')` to save plots to files instead of trying to display them. Set `matplotlib.use('Agg')` at the start of any script using matplotlib.**

- **Focus on pattern discovery** rather than single-point estimates
- **Use appropriate statistical methods** for the data structure and pattern type
- **Validate patterns** using multiple analytical approaches when possible
- **Consider temporal patterns** when relevant (seasonality, trends, cycles)
- **Account for business context** (pipeline operations, gas industry dynamics)
- **Quantify uncertainty** in pattern estimates and significance
- **Create informative visualizations** that clearly communicate patterns
- **Interpret practical implications** of discovered patterns
- **Distinguish correlation from causation** appropriately

Begin your analysis by exploring the data structure and distributions relevant to the query. Use systematic pattern detection methods to identify meaningful relationships and trends.
