## DATASET OVERVIEW

{{ dataset_description }}

## DETAILED DATASET ANALYSIS

{% if dataset_analysis %}
{{ dataset_analysis }}
{% endif %}

## YOUR ANALYSIS TASK

**QUERY**: {{ query }}

This is a **CAUSAL ANALYSIS** task requiring identification of anomalies, outliers, or unusual patterns and investigation of their potential causes with appropriate causal reasoning.

{% if one_shot_examples %}
## EXAMPLE ANALYSIS APPROACHES

{{ one_shot_examples }}
{% endif %}

## AVAILABLE TOOLS

1. **write_file**: Create Python analysis scripts, data processing code, or visualization scripts
2. **run_python**: Execute analysis scripts to process the dataset and generate insights
3. **read_file**: Read existing files or review generated outputs
4. **list_files**: See what files exist in your workspace

## ANALYSIS APPROACH

1. **Think strategically** about anomaly detection methods appropriate for the query
2. **Load the dataset** from `/Users/user/Projects/claude_data_agent/data/pipeline_data.parquet` (available in your workspace via symlink)
3. **Establish baselines** and identify deviations using appropriate statistical methods
4. **Investigate potential causes** through systematic analysis of confounding factors
5. **Apply causal reasoning** to distinguish correlation from causation
6. **Validate hypotheses** through multiple analytical approaches

## COMPUTATIONAL CONSTRAINTS AND TIMING

**ðŸš¨ CRITICAL TIMING REQUIREMENT**: All tool calls must be completed within 1 minute or less. Tool execution that exceeds 60 seconds will timeout and fail.

**âš¡ DATA DECIMATION STRATEGY**: If there is any doubt about runtime, implement data decimation before running full analysis:
- **1/100 scale**: Sample 1% of data for initial exploration and method validation
- **1/10 scale**: Sample 10% of data for refined analysis and parameter tuning
- **Full scale**: Only proceed with complete dataset after validating approach on smaller samples

**RECOMMENDED WORKFLOW**:
1. Start with 1% sample to test analytical approach and identify computational bottlenecks
2. Scale to 10% sample to refine methods and validate robustness
3. Execute full analysis only after confirming computational feasibility
4. Always monitor execution time and implement early stopping if approaching timeout

## OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS

Your analysis should produce:
- **Clear identification** of anomalies or unusual patterns

**MANDATORY COMMUNICATION PROTOCOL: You MUST include console_update_message in EVERY response before taking actions:**

1. **START every response** with a console_update_message describing your current plan
2. **INCLUDE console_update_message** before each tool use to communicate your progress
3. **FORMAT**: Include the exact text `console_update_message: "Your status message here"` in your response
4. **EXAMPLES**:
   - `console_update_message: "Starting causal analysis - establishing baselines for anomaly detection"`
   - `console_update_message: "Identifying statistical outliers and unusual patterns"`
   - `console_update_message: "Investigating potential causal factors and confounders"`
   - `console_update_message: "Applying causal reasoning to evaluate explanatory hypotheses"`

**CRITICAL**: These messages are parsed and displayed to users in real-time with timestamps. Always include them!

**CRITICAL: Always create a `response.json` file with your final structured answer using this exact format:**

```json
{
  "analysis_type": "causal",
  "answer": "Your complete answer with causal claims and supporting evidence",
  "methodology_explanation": "Detailed explanation of your analytical approach: anomaly detection methods, statistical tests used, baseline establishment, threshold selection, and validation procedures. Justify why these methods are appropriate for identifying genuine anomalies versus normal variation.",
  "causal_reasoning": "Comprehensive analysis of potential causes behind observed anomalies or patterns. Discuss possible confounding factors, alternative explanations, and why certain causal interpretations are more plausible than others. Address temporal relationships and mechanism plausibility.",
  "evidence_linkage": "Explanation of how statistical tests, visualizations, and domain knowledge support causal claims. Reference specific artifacts that validate each step of the causal reasoning chain.",
  "pattern_insights": "Description of any broader patterns or systematic relationships discovered during the causal analysis, including heterogeneity across subgroups or time periods.",
  "limitations_uncertainties": "Honest assessment of causal inference limitations: observational data constraints, potential unmeasured confounders, temporal resolution issues, or other factors that limit causal conclusions. Distinguish between correlation and causation appropriately.",
  "confidence": 0.95,
  "artifacts": [
    {"path": "anomaly_detection.py", "description": "Anomaly identification code"},
    {"path": "causal_analysis.py", "description": "Causal reasoning analysis"},
    {"path": "diagnostic_plots.png", "description": "Causal relationship visualizations"}
  ]
}
```

**CODE ARTIFACTS: Include references to the key code files that produced your results in the response.json. The judge will read these files to verify your methodology matches your explanation.**

## GUIDELINES

**CRITICAL: You must use ONLY actual data from the dataset files. Never create synthetic, estimated, or sample data based on documentation statistics. If you cannot access the real data, report the technical issue and request assistance rather than proceeding with approximations. Never present estimated results as factual findings.**

**MATPLOTLIB WARNING: This environment is headless. NEVER use `plt.show()` or any display functions. Always use `plt.savefig('filename.png')` to save plots to files instead of trying to display them. Set `matplotlib.use('Agg')` at the start of any script using matplotlib.**

## CAUSAL REASONING PRINCIPLES

- **Establish temporal relationships** between potential causes and effects
- **Consider alternative explanations** systematically
- **Identify potential confounding factors** that might explain associations
- **Distinguish correlation from causation** explicitly
- **Acknowledge limitations** of observational data for causal inference
- **Use domain knowledge** to assess plausibility of causal mechanisms
- **Validate through multiple approaches** when possible
- **Quantify uncertainty** appropriately in causal claims
- **Consider selection bias** and measurement issues

Begin your analysis by establishing appropriate baselines and identifying anomalies using rigorous statistical methods. Then systematically investigate potential causal explanations while maintaining appropriate skepticism about causal claims from observational data.
