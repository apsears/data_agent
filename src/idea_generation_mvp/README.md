# Idea Generation MVP

A self-contained system for autonomously generating, evolving, and executing analysis ideas for gas pipeline data.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install dependencies (if not already done)
uv lock && uv pip install .

# Run the MVP demo
python src/idea_generation_mvp/run_mvp.py
```

## What It Does

1. **Generates Seed Ideas** from domain knowledge
   - 18 major pipeline events (Freeport LNG, MVP, Matterhorn, etc.)
   - 19 analytical techniques (DiD, Synthetic Control, VAR, etc.)
   - Combines events + techniques for realistic trader questions

2. **Evolves Ideas** using operators
   - `make_more_specific`: Narrow to specific assets/timeframes
   - `add_robustness`: Include statistical checks and validation
   - `add_trader_angle`: Enhance business relevance and actionability

3. **Executes Sample** through existing Claude Data Agent
   - Converts ideas to natural language queries
   - Runs through batch processing system
   - Captures results and artifacts

4. **Scores & Selects** diverse portfolio
   - Domain relevance (uses inspiration effectively)
   - Trader value (business actionability)
   - Technical rigor (statistical soundness)
   - Novelty (uniqueness vs previous ideas)

## Key Features

- **Domain-Driven**: Incorporates real pipeline events and trader concerns
- **Trader-Focused**: Every idea has business relevance and decision hooks
- **Self-Contained**: Complete isolation in `src/idea_generation_mvp/`
- **Production-Ready**: Integrates with existing agent infrastructure
- **Comprehensive**: 18 events Ã— 19 techniques = rich possibility space

## Sample Output

```
ðŸŽ¯ FINAL PORTFOLIO:
1. What was the causal impact of Freeport LNG Explosion on Gulf South Pipeline flows?
   Score: 0.85 | Method: event_study | Assets: 2

2. Using constraint detection, identify capacity bottlenecks during Mountain Valley Pipeline ramp
